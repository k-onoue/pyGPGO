First of all, thank you for wanting to contribute. It is people like you that render open-source software possible.
Since pyGPGO is MIT Licensed, you can pretty much use the code here however it suits your needs, but if you want
to contribute to the existing codebase, please consider the following guidelines.

# How can I contribute to the project?

Essentially either by:
  1. Bug reporting.
  2. Suggesting a feature
  3. Contributing to the codebase
  
# Found a bug? Tell us about it!

Hey, your bug may already be fixed! Try to update to the latest pyGPGO version
(ideally the one provided in this repository) and check if it persists.

Open an issue using the tag `[BUG]` and try to be as descriptive as possible. Also tell us about:
  - your installed pyGPGO version.
  - your Python environment setup.
  - which OS you're running.

Ideally, we would also like to have a minimal working example of the issue for reproducibility. 
We'll fix your bug as soon as possible. 

# Got a feature request? 

We are always looking for interesting ideas to implement in the codebase. Open an issue with the tag
`[REQUEST]` and describe your idea in detail, ideally providing some references.

After appropriate discussion, if you're feeling adventurous, you can implement your own idea and open
a pull request on the repository. We will review it in due time and approve it shall it meet our
quality criteria.
